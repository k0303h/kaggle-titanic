Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This is my first submission to Prediction Competition at Kaggle. 
I refered to https://github.com/minsuk-heo/kaggle-titanic/tree/master. And the code is also made based on that. 

Tried 'kNN', 'Decision Tree', 'Ramdom Forest', 'Naive Bayes' and 'SVM'. And used the 'SVM' for the final testing.
